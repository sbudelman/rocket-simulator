# Rocket Simulator

A framework to simulate model rockets control systems. Work in progress.

The initial development of this project will be documented as part of a YouTube series (linked here when it goes live). The code to be presented on the series will be registered as branches named after the episode number.

**Disclaimer here:** I am a mechanical engineer but have no experience in aerospace and Iâ€™ve never implemented something like this before. I expect at times to be mistaken, either due to misunderstanding some principles and/or failing to write good code. I will appreciate your feedback whenever this is the case and will do my best to let you know when errors and inaccuracies are spotted. Finally, if you decide to use any of this material please know that you are doing so at your own responsibility.

## Roadmap

- [ ] 2-D Rocket dynamics with thrust vectoring
- [ ] PID controller implementation
- [ ] Robust control:
  - [ ] Delays and dead times
  - [ ] Sensor modelling
  - [ ] Noise and perturbances
- [ ] Controlled descent
- [ ] Trajectory planning
- [ ] 3-D Rocket dynamics and control
